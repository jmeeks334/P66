 #Analyzer Reliability Group
 
 My goal with this project was to eliminate time spent on manual data entry and cumbersome spreadsheet work.  During semiannual reporting, I was required to open each of the 55 spreadsheets to capture and calculate data on emissions and analyzer downtime.  Analyzer technicians opened the sheets daily to record their maintenance activities, check calibration results, and view analyzer output trends.
