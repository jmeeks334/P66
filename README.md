# P66 Projects

This repository houses a few samples of projects I've completed while working at P66.

When I began working in the environmental group at the P66 Ponca City Refinery (PCR), I guickly found a niche for improving work processes.  A few of my notable projects are captured here.

ARG - Analyzer Reliability Group.  As of this writing, there are 55 continuous emission analyzers at PCR. This includes NOx, CO, SO2, O2, H2S and TRS analyzers.  Each analyzer system must comply with strict regulatory QA/QC, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.  When I started in the role in 2018, each analyzer had it's own separate Excel spreadsheet.  The spreadsheet was used to record the daily calibration and maintenance information along with capturing live process values.  Each sheet was opened multiple times daily by analyzer technicians and environmental personnel.  I immediately loathed the setup and started looking for a better way.  This lead me on my initial journey into coding.

ENV - Environmental Group.  The ARG analyzers mentioned above provide information on emissions from refinery sources such as fired heaters, boilers, and flares.  The environmental group is responsible for ensuring that emissions do not exceed permitted limits.  There are strict recordkeeping and reporting requirements as well as frequent audits and investigations by state and federal agencies.  Many of the emission limits are based on long-term averages such as a rolling 365d period.  In addition to permit limits, there is a requirement to tally up and report annual emissions of criteria, toxic, and greenhouse gas pollutant emissions.  When I started in work in the group, the tracking and reporting systems in place for these requirements were based on lots and lots of spreadsheets and manual data entry!  Needless to say, I got to work improving things.  

Overall, I estimate that I reduced approximately 1,200 work hours per year by automating and improving the systems in the environmental group.  More importantly, the work I did in the group sparked a new found passion for all things data, coding, analytics, visualization, and more. 

In 2022, I moved into a new role as a process controls engineer.  In this role I am even more involved in programming, database management, networking and server virtualization and administration projects.  I continue to be passionate about increasing my knowledge of ways to improve efficiency, gaining insights out of data, and providing novel solutions to refinery process control systems.
